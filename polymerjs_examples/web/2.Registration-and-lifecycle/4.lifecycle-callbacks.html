<!-- Polymer’s Base prototype implements the standard Custom Element lifecycle
callbacks to perform tasks necessary for Polymer’s built-in features. The hooks
in turn call shorter-named lifecycle methods on your prototype.

 * created instead of createdCallback
 * attached instead of attachedCallback
 * detached instead of detachedCallback
 * attributeChanged instead of attributeChangedCallback

You can fallback to using the low-level methods if you prefer (in other words,
you can simply implement createdCallback in your prototype).

Polymer adds an extra callback, ready, which is invoked when Polymer has finished
creating and initializing the element’s local DOM. -->

<script type="application/dart">
  import "package:polymerjs_examples/polymer.dart";

  @initMethod
  main() {
    Polymer.call({
      "is": "lifecycle-callbacks",

      "created": (PolymerElement self) {
        print("${self.tagName} was created");
      },
      "attached": (PolymerElement self) {
        print("${self.tagName} was attached");
      },
      "detached": (PolymerElement self) {
        print("${self.tagName} was detached");
      },
      "attributeChanged": (PolymerElement self, name, type) {
        print("${self.tagName} attribute"
        " was changed to ${self.getAttribute(name)}");
      }
    });

    PolymerElement customElement = new PolymerElement('lifecycle-callbacks')
      ..appendTo(document.body);
    customElement.setAttribute("id", "myid");
